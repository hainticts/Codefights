You're given three integers, a, b and c. It is guaranteed that two of these integers are equal to each other. 
What is the value of the third integer?

Example

For a = 2, b = 7 and c = 2, the output should be
extraNumber(a, b, c) = 7.

The two equal numbers are a and c. The third number (b) equals 7, which is the answer.

    Input:

    a: 3
    b: 2
    c: 2

    Expected Output:

    3

    Input:

    a: 5
    b: 5
    c: 1

    Expected Output:

    1

    Input:

    a: 500000000
    b: 3
    c: 500000000

    Expected Output:

    3
