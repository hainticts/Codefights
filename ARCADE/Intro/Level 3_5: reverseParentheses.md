  You have a string s that consists of English letters, punctuation marks, whitespace characters, and brackets. 
It is guaranteed that the parentheses in s form a regular bracket sequence.
  A bracket sequence is called regular if it is possible to insert some numbers and signs into the sequence in
such a way that the new sequence will represent a correct arithmetic expression.
  Your task is to reverse the strings contained in each pair of matching parentheses, starting from the innermost pair. 
The results string should not contain any parentheses.



Example

For string s = "a(bc)de", the output should be
reverseParentheses(s) = "acbde".

For string  s =  "a(bcdefghijkl(mno)p)q" the output should be "apmnolkjihgfedcbq".

For string  s =  "co(de(fight)s)" the output should be "cosfighted"

For string  s =  "Code(Cha(lle)nge)" the output should be "CodeegnlleahC"

For string  s =  "abc(cba)ab(bac)c" the output should be "abcabcabcabc"

For string  s = "The ((quick (brown) (fox) jumps over the lazy) dog)" 
the output should be "The god quick nworb xof jumps over the lazy"
